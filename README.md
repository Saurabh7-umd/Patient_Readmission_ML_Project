Project: Predicting Important Features for Readmission of Diabetic Patients

I. Introduction:
Hospital readmissions pose a significant challenge in the healthcare sector, impacting patient well-being and healthcare expenses. Our initiative focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict readmissions among diabetic patients, aiming to enhance patient care quality and reduce healthcare expenditures.

II. Executive Summary:
Our study explores predictive modeling of hospital readmissions for diabetic patients using PySpark. We encountered dataset imbalance issues, which we addressed through oversampling methods. We emphasize the importance of expert consultation for refining feature selection and enhancing predictive accuracy. Our study presents a novel approach to healthcare data analytics using PySpark, aiming for more accurate and scalable predictive models.
